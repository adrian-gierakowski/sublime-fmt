`Fmt` has a new command for selection formatting!

* Palette title: `Fmt: Format Selection`
* Command name for hotkeys: `fmt_format_selection`

Example hotkey:

```json
{"keys": ["primary+k", "primary+k"], "command": "fmt_format_selection"},
```

Selection formatting even works for embedded syntaxes, choosing settings/rules by the scope at the start of each region. For example, you can format a block of JSON or Go embedded in a Markdown file.

When you have different formatters configured for both inner and outer syntaxes, it may currently choose the outer one. This could be rectified on demand.
