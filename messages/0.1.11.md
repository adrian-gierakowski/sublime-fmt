`Fmt` now uses `"merge_type": "replace"` by default. This avoids worst-case freezes caused by poor combinatorial complexity of the diff algorithm. When using a precise formatter that generates few diffs, such as `gofmt` or `rustfmt`, it's safe to opt into diffing, which is better at preserving scroll and cursor position.

Example config:

```json
{
  "rules": [
    // Explicit diff merge.
    {
      "selector": "source.go",
      "cmd": ["goimports"],
      "format_on_save": true,
      "merge_type": "diff",
    },
    // Uses default replace merge.
    {
      "selector": "source.json",
      "cmd": ["jsonfmt"],
    },
  ],
}
```
